#  Grid Game

[Start Game Button Demo](https://share.cleanshot.com/Wcp2MgsL): This video demonstrates that the start game button is enabled only if both row and columns are greater than zero
[Small Grid Demo - 2x2](https://share.cleanshot.com/C4lTrg29)
[Large Grid Demo - 7x9](https://share.cleanshot.com/vZZjq6fk): I've recorded the video on iPhone 12 mini (one of the smallest screens). You can see that the grid scrolls in horizontal direction for 9 columns. FYI, the grid scrolls vertically for 20 rows as well.
